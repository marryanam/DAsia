            <h2>What makes Russian wives so great?</h2>
            <p>Before you make the decision to date Russian girls, you probably want to learn more about the things that
              make girls from Russia such great girlfriends. When you
              start a relationship with a Russian beauty, this is what you can expect.
            </p>
            <img src="img/56565.png" alt="#" style="float: left;" class="img-left">
            <h4>She is gorgeous</h4>
            <p>Even though some may consider putting a woman’s appearance first, we
              believe it’s nothing but practical. You simply want to enjoy the sight of your
              girlfriend if you are going to spend many weeks, days, or months with her.
            </p>
            <p> The beauty of Russian girls is one of the first things you learn about them.
            What is even more important that girls in Russia are often not even aware
            of their stunning looks and that makes them even more lovable.
            </p>
            <p>Russian girls are also pros when it comes to taking care of their appearance.
              They maintain their physical features and physique for years and always
              know what to wear and which makeup to put on to make the right
              impression.
            </p>
            <h4>She is intelligent</h4>
            <p>Few people know this, but Russian girls are some of the most intelligent
              women on the planet. From a very young age, these girls receive an
              excellent education. Most of them graduate from prestigious universities and have great career prospects. Many
              girls in Russia grow up to be bookworms and have an endless range of interests. When you talk to your Russian
              girlfriend, you are going to be surprised by how fiercely intelligent and well-read she is. This is especially important
              if you plan to regularly take your sweetheart to social
              functions, where she will undoubtedly charm everyone.
            </p>

            <h4>She is loyal</h4>
            <p>Even though Russian girls are getting more modern and may not be actively seeking marriage right after they
              meet a man, at their heart, they are extremely loyal.
              When they find someone they can see a future with, they will never look at another man again.
              For a Russian girl, loyalty means not only being faithful to the man they love, but also sticking with him
              through the good and the bad. If you are searching for a
              true partner who will stand by your side no matter what, dating a Russian girl is the best way to get what
              you want.
            </p>

            <h4>She is hospitable</h4>
            <p>Western men, who are used to local women being less than passionate about homemaking, are pleasantly
              surprised when they start a relationship with a Russian
              girl. The reason for that is that every girl from Russia is a world-class chef, interior decorator, and
              cleaner.
              The best thing about it is that they don’t consider all these things a chore and actually enjoy doing them.
              The cooking skills of Russian girls are already the subject
              of legends. You can look forward to traditional Russian delicacies and trendy dishes gracing your dinner
              table day after day.
            </p>

            <h4>She is fun</h4>
            <p>People in Russia are often portrayed as serious and moody, but that’s definitely not what you experience
              with a Russian girlfriend. These girls are cheerful, have a
              great sense of humor, and always know what to say to lift your spirits. There won’t be a boring weekend with
              your Russian girlfriend. Even when you don’t go out
              doing something you both love, you will still have lots of fun when you are staying in. Plus, you will
              probably quickly find a shared hobby that will bring you
              even closer.
            </p>

            <h2>Why You Should Date Them</h2>
            <p>With so many Russian girls dating websites promising to connect you to Russian brides, you can’t help but
              wonder: are these women really as stunning, kind, and
              loving as everyone says? We all know someone who found happiness with a Russian girlfriend or wife, but
              finding a Russian girlfriend is not as easy as it may
              seem.
            </p>
            <p>The biggest challenge of dating a Russian girl is the long distance between you and your potential dream
              woman. However, that problem is easily solved by signing
              up to one of the many international dating platforms.
            </p>
            <p>One more reason why some men hesitate to date a Russian beauty is the fact that we know very little
              about  them, which is why they may seem intimidating and
              difficult to date. The good news is that a Russian girl is, perhaps, the best girlfriend you can ever have,
              and here are 10 reasons to prove it.
            </p>
            <img src="img/56565.png" alt="#" style="float: right;" class="img-right">
            <h4>1. Beauty</h4>
            <p>Men are often called shallow for wanting a beautiful girlfriend, but, to us, it is
              very practical. If you want to wake up every day to your girlfriend’s gorgeous
              appearance, no one can blame you. And Russian girls are known for being
              some of the best-looking women on the planet.
            </p>
            <b>There are actually three reasons why you see so many fabulous Russian
              girls online and in the city streets: </b>
            <ul>
              <li>First, they are blessed with wonderful genetics, which gives them very
                different but equally beautiful features. The genetic pool of Russian girls
                is so diverse that you can find even the most unusual types and traits.
              </li>
              <li>Second, they are well aware of their beauty and do everything to make
                their appearance more striking. From tasteful makeup to stylish clothes,
                these girls know how to stun with their looks.
              </li>
              <li>Third, girls in Russia are determined to stay young and beautiful for as
                long as possible. They take good care of their skin, keep in shape.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Generosity</h4>
            <p>One of the biggest benefits of Russian girls for dating is that these women are prepared to give without
              expecting much in return. They spend their life waiting for
              the right man, and once they find him, they surround him with all the love and care they are capable of.
            </p>
            <p>The generosity of Russian girls is displayed in different ways. They will always serve you the best piece
              at dinner, offer you a cold drink after you’ve been working
              outside, and run errands for you if you are particularly busy.
            </p>
            <p> If you are dating Russian girl, you can always expect to be taken care of, whether you are sick or
               simply came home from work. Generosity is a big part of the
              character of any Russian girl, and you cannot live life to the fullest unless you experience it.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Intelligence</h4>
            <p>There is so much said about the beauty of Russian girls, but it is impossible to talk about dating a girl
              from Russia without mentioning how intelligent they are. Most Russian girls get a very good education, which gives them not only career opportunities, but also a
              well-rounded outlook on life.</p>
            <p> From a young age, a Russian girl grows up with a love of books, and this love does not go anywhere as
              she becomes older. Russian girls are always looking for new
              ways to learn and can surprise you with their range of interests.</p>
            <p> The incredible intelligence of Russian ladies means that you will not only easily find things to talk
              about on a date, but also successfully introduce her into even the
              most high-brow circle. She will never embarrass you, charming everyone with her wit and depth instead.
            </p>

            <h4>4. Straightforwardness</h4>
            <p>If you are used to Western girls being very secretive and never telling it like it is, you are probably
              wondering: how to date a Russian girl? We are happy to tell you
              that the directness of Russian girls is one of the biggest reasons why they make such great girlfriends.
            </p>
            <p> Girls in Russia learn to be very direct early in life, but they only use this trait for good causes.
               Your Russian girlfriend will never complain and demand things just
              because she is in a bad mood — her remarks are always well-grounded and fair. 
            </p>
            <p> You may not be used to this kind of straightforwardness in a relationship, but soon you will see that
              it’s a  much better way to live. When someone in a relationship
              is unhappy about something, it’s healthier to discuss it right away than to accumulate anger and resentment.
            </p>
            <img src="img/56565.png" alt="#" style="float: left;" class="img-left">

            <h4>5. Passion</h4>
            <p>Often in the media, girls from Russia are portrayed as cold and indifferent,
              which is not only untrue, but also unfair. Those who have had the pleasure to
              date Russian girls say that there is no one more loving and tender than a
              Russian girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p> However, you shouldn’t expect a girl from Russia to jump into your open arms
              immediately after meeting you. Due to their upbringing and past dating
              experiences, Russian girls need to get to know their man before they can
              open up to him.
            </p>
            <p> Once that happens, you will never feel unloved in this relationship. When she
              knows you have serious intentions and are in for a long run, your Russian
              girlfriend will finally reveal all the passion and fire that has been flaring up in
              her soul for years. Once that happens, you will never feel unloved in this relationship. When she
              knows you have serious intentions and are in for a long run.
            </p>

            <h4>6. Loyalty</h4>
            <p>When entering a relationship with a man, a girl from Russia is not just looking for a fling — she wants to
              find a partner. If you are ready to become a faithful partner
              to your Russian girlfriend, you can expect her to do the same for you tenfold.
            </p>
            <p> So what does it mean for a Russian girl to have a partner in her boyfriend or husband? A partner is
              someone she is always ready to support. Whether you need her
              to lift your spirits after a bad day at work or to give you valuable advice about your future, you can get
              all that and more if you just come to her for support.
            </p>
            <p> Moreover, Russian girls are famously faithful. As long as she is in a relationship with an equally
              faithful
              partner, the thought of spending time with another man will
              never even cross her mind. With a Russian girlfriend, fidelity is always a guarantee.

            </div>

            <h4>7. Modern views</h4>
            <p>We are used to thinking about Russian girls as women with an old-school mentality, but the truth is that
              they are often as modern and forward-thinking as Western
              women.
            </p>
            <b>For your relationship with a Russian beauty, it can mean the following three things: </b>
            <ul>
              <li>She will not pressure you into marriage right away and will be happy letting your relationship evolve
                naturally. Even
                though Russian girls are completely
                monogamous and faithful, they are in no rush to get married right away, especially if they are under 30.
              </li>
              <li>If your Russian girlfriend is working and has a respectable career, there is a 99% chance that she’ll
                want to continue
                working even after things get serious
                between the two of you. Most women in Russia are not dreaming of becoming homemakers and they can
                successfully combine
                working full-time with a
                relationship and, later, marriage.
              </li>
              <li>While Russian girls appreciate when guys behave like gentlemen and act tough as rocks, they are also
                capable of taking
                care of themselves without waiting for
                their knight in shining armor to solve their problems for them.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>8. Entertaining personality</h4>
            <p>A Russian girl can be many things, but boring is what she definitely isn’t. Girls in Russia never feel bored
              even when they are on their own, so, naturally, they transfer
              the same cheerful outlook to their relationship.
            </p>
            <p>While your Russian girlfriend will be okay with just chilling at home during the weekend from time to
              time, she will also want to find new ways to spend time with
              you. Whether it’s finding a joint hobby, visiting a gallery opening, or organizing an improvised family
              picnic, there is always something to look forward to.
            </p>
            <p>And even when you are not doing anything special, you will never feel bored. Russian girls have a  bubbly and outgoing personality that they gladly use to
              add a spark to their relationship.
            </p>
            <img src="img/56565.png" alt="#" style="float: right;" class="img-right">
            <h4>9. Family values</h4>
            <p>No matter how career-oriented a modern Russian girl can be, she will
              always be focused on her family. Most girls in Russia do not want to hurry
              with getting married and having children, but, to them, it’s a natural stage
              of the relationship.</p>
            <p>Once you go from being a girlfriend and boyfriend to being a husband and
              wife, you can expect your woman’s priorities to change. If the two of you
              decide to start a family and have children, you should know that there is no
              one better to picture as the mother of your kids.
            </p>

            <h4>10. Homemaking</h4>
            <p>Being a successful career lady doesn’t prevent a Russian girl from being an
              expert when it comes to homemaking. These girls seem naturally talented
              in everything that makes a cozy home, including interior decoration and
              cleaning.</p>
            <p>We also feel obligated to mention the amazing cooking skills of Russian girls. They grow up learning the
              traditional recipes and cooking tricks from their mothers and grandmothers, and by the
              time they begin a relationship with you, they
              are true cooking pros.
            </p>
            <p>Russian cuisine can be described as filling, homelike, and very diverse. There are refreshing salads,
              warming soups,
              delicious meat delicaccies, exotic side dishes,
              and of course, the famous Russian desserts. Living with a world-class chef that specializes in Russian cuisine certainly
              doesn’t sound too bad!
            </p>

            <h2>How to Date a Russian Girl</h2>
            <p>In many ways, dating a Russian girl is not that different from the romantic experience you may already have.
              However, there are also some standout aspects of
              dating a girl from Russia you should know about.
            </p>
            <b>Here are a few tips on how to date a Russian girl.</b>
            <ol>
              <li>Express your feelings openly. Russian girls may seem demure and distant, but they immediately change
                once
                they find out you are interested in them
                romantically and want to build a relationship. That is why it’s so important to learn to openly talk about
                your feelings.
              </li>
              <li>Show her that you care. A typical Russian girl loves all the attention she can get from a man. From a
                simple text wishing her a good morning to making sure she
                gets home safely after a date, expressing these little episodes of attention is the foundation for a happy
                relationship.
              </li>
              <li>Don’t pressure her into anything. While some Russian girls prefer to quickly advance the relationship,
                most
                ladies prefer to take it slow. She will tell you when she
                is ready to take the relationship to the next stage. Don’t expect to come in for a cup of tea on your
                first or
                second date, but if that happens, consider yourself lucky!
              </li>
              <li>Make an effort with your look. If there is one thing that is always said about girls in Russia, it’s
                that
                they always look put- together and appropriate. Naturally, she
                will expect the same from you. You don’t need to wear an expensive tuxedo to a movie date, but you always
                need
                to look clean, fresh, and well-groomed.
              </li>
              <li>Act like a gentleman. When dating a Russian girl, you will need to remember your chivalry skills.
                Surely,
                you may not have used them for a while, but Russian girls
                are old-fashioned in this regard and expect their man to open the door for them, pick up the check, and
                lend
                them your jacket when it’s chilly outside.
              </li>
              <li>Be interested in her culture. Russian girls are usually very familiar with Western culture and often
                watch
                the same TV shows and listen to the same music as you
                do. However, Russian culture is also a big part of a Russian girl’s identity, and you should make an
                effort to
                know more about it. Even learning a couple of phrases
                in Russian to surprise her will definitely hit the right spot.
              </li>
              <li>Meet her parents and friends. A social circle consisting of family members and friends is one of the
                most
                important things for a girl from Russia. Volunteering to
                meet her parents and doing your best to impress them will cement your position as the best boyfriend ever.
                If
                you manage to become a part of her friend circle, it
                will make your relationship stronger.
              </li>
              <li>Support her in her aspirations. Even though some Russian girls are happy just being homemakers, the
                majority of them put their higher education to good use
                and strive to build a brilliant career. If you support her aspirations, help her prepare for interviews,
                and
                are willing to talk about her goals, she will appreciate you
                even more.
              </li>
              <li>Surprise her with gifts. The old-fashioned part of the personality of a Russian girl makes them very
                excited every time they get a present from their loved one. It
                doesn’t have to be an expensive smartphone or jewelry: even a bouquet of flowers or a new lipstick you
                know
                she’s wanted for some time is enough to put her in a
                good mood.
              </li>
              <li>Be yourself. It is very tempting to pretend to be someone else when you want to woo your Russian beauty,
                but the truth will always come out. Even if you
                believe you are not perfect, it’s best to just be sincere. If you don’t pretend to be someone you are not
                and
                always tell the truth, your girl will accept you the way
                you are.
              </li>
            </ol>
