            <h2>Your privacy is our priority</h2>
            <p>We, the team of Mail-Order-Bride, treat the privacy of our visitors extremely seriously. Any information
              we gathered through mail-order-bride.com (hereinafter, “the Site”, “the Website”,
              or “mail-order-bride.com”) is treated with the respect to your privacy rights: the personally-identifying
              data you provide while exploiting the Site is under protection. This Privacy Policy
              applies to the Website and has been developed to clarify what kind of data we might collect on the Site,
              how this data might be used, and what kind of conditions might lead to the
              disclosure of the data to third parties. This Privacy Policy covers only the data which we gather with the
              help of the Website: any information we collect from other sources is not
              influenced by this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy and Terms of Use constitute the set of rules,
              rights, and obligations you are expected to follow and abide by when utilizing the
              Website. In certain cases, you might be asked to accept additional terms.
            </p>
            <h2>The Site Visitors</h2>
            <p>The Website regularly aggregates the information that does not identify the personality of the user. This
              data is usually being made available by browsers and servers. The disclosed
              information includes the type of the browser exploited, the language selected, site references, the time
              and date a particular user visits the Site. The reason why such non-personally-
              identifying data is being collected and perceived as important is that it helps us to find out how our
              clients exploit the Website. This kind of information might be occasionally released
              in a form of an aggregated database or in a form of a generalized report reflecting the key trends in the
              exploitation of mail-order-bride.com. We also collect some sort of personally-
              identifying data. Those users who log in to the Site and those who post their commentaries on the Website
              have their IP addresses detected and recorded. This information would be
              disclosed only in the selected cases and under conditions which are listed below.
            </p>
            <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Data</h2>
            <p>To some extent, the disclosure of personally-identifying information depends on the Site visitors. Some
              activities on mail-order-bride.com require providing the additional data. For
              instance, when users decide to post their reviews they are supposed to sign in and provide their email
              addresses and usernames. We will gather this information and keep it. But not
              all the users are obliged to provide us with such data.
            </p>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We are doing our best to guarantee you a decent level of data protection: we exploit the tools that help
              us to protect your personal information from leakage and misuse. However,
              you should remember that we cannot give you 100% guarantee that your data would not be compromised. You
              should be aware that when you share any information on the Web or
              store any files online you face certain risks.
            </p>
            <h2>Adverting on the Site</h2>
            <p>We cooperate with several advertising partners and their ads may occasionally appear on the Site.
              Usually, the cookie files are being utilized. It means that every time when you see
              an ad on the Website the advertising server detects your computer or gadget and collects certain
              information about you or the one exploiting your computer or gadget at the moment.
              The information gathered in such way helps companies to provide you with targeted ads that, supposedly,
              reflect your interests and fit your needs. According to this Privacy Policy, the
              exploitation of cookies by external parties is not regulated – only the use of cookies by the Site is
              covered.
            </p>
            <h2>Links to External Sites</h2>
            <p>On the Website, you may see links redirecting you to the external platforms. When you click on such link
              and open the page, we assume to have no responsibility for the outcome. We
              have no control over the content and policies of the third parties sites and all the consequences of
              visiting such sites are your own responsibility. We recommend you to be cautious, to
              check out privacy policies and terms of use of every new site you visit.
            </p>
            <h2>Utilization of AdWords</h2>
            <p>Those who have already visited mail-order-bride.com may see the ads of our services among Google search
              results or on the websites of third parties. Hence, we use the information
              about your previous visits to offer you to come back again and continue cooperation with us. We collect
              the data on your previous activity due to cookies. Third parties and Google do
              the same. These actions do not threat your privacy as any data gathered with the help of cookies will be
              used exclusively in the ways that are consistent with our Privacy Policy and
              privacy policy of Google. Therefore, none of your privacy rights are under the threat of violation. You
              can manage the ads Google shows you by changing settings at Google Ad
              Preferences page. If you are not interested in any ads at all you have a chance to refuse seeing
              advertising – you have to alter cookies settings or apply specific plug-ins for your
              browser.
            </p>
            <h2>Personally-Identifying Data: Selective Protection</h2>
            <p>There are only two cases when we disclose information which is truly or potentially
              personally-identifying to third parties, our own employees and contractors or the actors we are
              affiliated with. Thus, we share such data if: It is required to guarantee the proper functioning of the
              Website and the availability of all the functions; The third party gave a promise not
              to transmit the information further. In some case, people we share the data with are being located in
              geographically remote areas. If you keep on using mail-order-bride.com we assume
              that you agree on the transfer of your data to the countries where third parties are being located. There
              are no cases in which we sell or rent your truly or potentially personally-identifying
              data. The only additional reason why such information might be disclosed lies within the legal field: if
              we receive a subpoena, any request from a court or government we are obliged to
              disclose your data. Also, in a case we consider you to be a threat to the safety of the Website, its
              property or rights, we preserve our right to make your data available to third parties or
              the general public. Considering you created an account at the Site, your email address has been added to
              our list of contacts. Therefore, we might send you letters informing you about
              the latest functions and services we offer, asking you to take part in a survey or to provide your
              feedback, or letting you know about the general news considering our Site and products.
              We will not overwhelm you with our emails as usually we post all the essential information in our blog
              which you can find on the Website. Considering you contact us directly and ask to
              solve a certain issue we might post your request and the solution we offer in order to let the other users
              know how they may deal with the identical problem. We are doing our best to
              eliminate any risks and situations in which your truly or potentially personally-identifying data might be
              somehow compromised – accessed by unauthorized individuals, used without
              your permission, changed or deleted.
            </p>
            <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
            <p>When you exploit the Site we collect certain statistic data concerning behavior and actions of the
              Website visitors. This statistic information may be disclosed and shared publicly only
              in a generalized and aggregated form. It means that none of your personally-identifying data would be
              disclosed separately.
            </p>
            <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>We admit placing affiliate links on the Website. Some of them bring us commission but the fact that we
              benefit from links does not mean that the prices you pay or the very process of
              purchasing any services is being somehow affected.
            </p>
            <h2>Cookies</h2>
            <p>As we want you to benefit from our services fully, we utilize so-called “Cookies” which allow us to
              follow your activity on the Website, trace your preferences and provide you with
              personalized content (e.g., advertising which you see displayed in Google search results). The idea behind
              cookies is pretty simple: whenever you visit the Site information about the
              session is being saved on your computer and next time when you enter the Website again your browser
              transmits the data about your visit to the Site. Hence, we got an opportunity to
              monitor who visits our Website, to find out the patterns of mail-order-bride.com exploitation, and to
              detect the main preferences of the visitors. If you do not want your browser to store
              cookies you may change the standard settings. As the result, we would not get an access to your activity
              but you should be informed that some functions of the Website might fail to
              work properly when cookies are not being applied. If you do not alter the basic settings we assume that
              you understand that we use cookies and that you agree on that.
            </p>
            <h2>Alterations in Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We keep our right to alter this Privacy Policy. The possible changes are likely to be minor and to some
              extent insignificant. Anyway, we recommend you to look through this Privacy
              Policy on a regular basis in order not to miss any alteration that might somehow affect you. In a case, a
              particular change was mentioned in this Privacy Policy and after that you kept
              on visiting the Site we assume that you agree with the alteration and accept it.
            </p>
